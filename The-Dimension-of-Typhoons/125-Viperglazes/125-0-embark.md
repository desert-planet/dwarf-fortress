Established *15th Granite, 125* in early spring by the benevolent @sshirokov.

Since none have survived to tell of my previous failures my own good word must have been heard.

It's not like they just **give** dwawrves to anyone right?

This time, I've managed to take hold of another band of 7. They call themselves `The Uncommon Rock`, from `The Subtle Mountain`.

The leader, which was elected poorly as I can only guess, sees the majority of the band is disposable, which is a nice start:

The leader that `Viperglazes` deserves.

We set out next to a mountain, which has always felt like home. The wagon parks not far from the cliffs, with a river to the north and very, **very** few trees.
