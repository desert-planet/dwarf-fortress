We have arrived, might as well make the best of it. Without stressing too hard at the beginning, I grant work privilege two dwarves. Those who can mine, must, and for that work they won't have to carry.

I have my eyes set on a nice corner in the mountain

This will make a nice entrance, I think. Let's set to work. I'll cut down the slopes

then enter a lowered cave from where we can grow.

The miners agree, as if they had a choise
