### 15th Granite, 125, Early Spring

![so cute](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/26111L160i2q/Screen%20Recording%202015-12-09%20at%209.48.55%20PM.gif)

We have arrived, might as well make the best of it. Without stressing too hard at the beginning, I grant work privilege two dwarves. Those who can mine, must, and for that work they won't have to carry.

I have my eyes set on a nice corner in the mountain

![corner](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/1M3V2n2u1J2z/Image%202015-12-09%20at%209.53.46%20PM.png)

This will make a nice entrance, I think. Let's set to work. I'll cut down the slopes

then enter a lowered cave from where we can grow.

The miners agree, as if they had a choice

![nope](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/0u1R1r410n0c/Screen%20Recording%202015-12-09%20at%209.58.28%20PM.gif)

### 18th Granite, 125, Early Spring

I've slept on it, and have had a brilliant idea.

![open atrium](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/1i0N0q2x030C/Image%202015-12-10%20at%209.57.24%20PM.png)

We're going to have a pretty baller area for showing up in.

The plan calls for a workshop as soon as possible, so we can start putting some of our stones to use to make doors. :soon:

The priorities should get things built faster.

![office space](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/391v3Z1Q1936/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.00.52%20PM.png)

I like managing dwarves by hand about as much as I like being on actual :fire:, so right next to where I plan the initial storage and industry I'm going to fast track an office for the expedition leader.

She's about to have a lot to do, and to great precision.

![quantities over qualities](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/1b1F2W1d2D1s/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.04.08%20PM.png)

The hope hasn't been crushed yet. All things in due time.

![hope](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/2v2M2p1k0m1I/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.05.03%20PM.png)

Now, outdoors. The animals can graze a bit west of the wagon.

It's not close enough to matter, and we're not exactly covered in grass. The refuse and corpses go just south of that, for now at least.

### 19th Granite, 125, Early Spring

Fuck fishing. How about do something useful.

![lolno](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/2U261E3f2c2M/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.18.21%20PM.png)

On second though, let's just remember that and get a fishery.

And while on the topic

![river](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/1I2Q200p292J/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.19.35%20PM.png)

Better have a water source if we need one.

### 21st Granite, 125, Early Spring

I'm slowly realizing what planning benefits.

![picks](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/1J0D2i2B3u2g/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.21.38%20PM.png)

I'll need to remember to make up for this vacation.

![jobs](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/1t0r0D1Z0j10/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.20.21%20PM.png)

We're almost near a workshop area, though.

### 23rd Granite, 125, Early Spring

![the mason's workshop is in progress](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/3b0I172F3x2D/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.27.38%20PM.png)

The mason is getting put down. Time to put some of these rocks to use!

Might as well set up for a mechanic, and plan for a  drawbridge instead of doors.

![more workshops](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/2y3C272e2g2m/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.28.48%20PM.png)

### 27th Granite, 125, Early Spring

To start gathering all the woods in the yard, I'm going to start piling them in front of the entrance.

![wood pile](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/041P0k3f141V/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.36.09%20PM.png)

It'll at least give the lazy suckers something to do.

### 28th Granite, 125, Early Spring

![workshop](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/312J2E2U3b3d/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.39.03%20PM.png)

Time to set up the mechanic's shop, before the mason's shop is even finished :crying_cat_face:

![office](http://f.cl.ly/items/22043b1f2W1S3P1M3o2X/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.40.55%20PM.png)

The office is dug, too bad the lazy dorfs haven't gotten to the workshops, so I don't have doors, chairs, or tables.

### 9th Slate, 125, Mid-Spring

It took most of the season, but we can finally make our way towards management!

![office furnishings](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/3M3n3m240R25/Screen%20Recording%202015-12-10%20at%2010.46.34%20PM.gif)

Soon, things will finally kick up.... as soon as we can find the mason.

![wood](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/2m1Q2P3o3P0U/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.49.14%20PM.png)

At least the wood cache (:trollface:) is filling up.

### 13th Slate, 125, Mid-Spring

![chair and table](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/1p293G3X1x0i/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.50.19%20PM.png)

We're almost a well oiled machine! I'm not going to wait for doors to get things started.

![claimed](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/412g280S3a0d/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.52.08%20PM.png)

And the general stockpile is starting to take shape.

### 16th Slate, 125, Mid-Spring

![yes](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/211M2P1U3d3Y/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.53.42%20PM.png)

And we're off!

![nobles](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/1W1o0z06132H/Image%202015-12-10%20at%2010.54.04%20PM.png)

How nice it is to be a proper civilization. (Or so I'm told.)
