### 1st Hematite, 125, Early Spring

The drink is falling, so the faster we can get to brewing, the better.

On the second floor I've designed a termination for the farm tunnel, a place to store food, and couple of nooks to place a kitchen and a still.

A damn shame we only have to picks to this day.

And now, for some deffence, before it's too late.

A pair of drawbridges will protect the entrances to the main fort, as well as the farm.

They're built of granite, because I'm classy.

 But still just the two picks. This is going to be the kind of fun that takes a while.
