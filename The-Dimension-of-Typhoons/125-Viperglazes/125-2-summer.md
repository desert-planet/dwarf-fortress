### 1st Hematite, 125, Early Spring

The drink is falling, so the faster we can get to brewing, the better.

On the second floor I've designed a termination for the farm tunnel, a place to store food, and couple of nooks to place a kitchen and a still.

A damn shame we only have to picks to this day.

And now, for some deffence, before it's too late.

A pair of drawbridges will protect the entrances to the main fort, as well as the farm.

They're built of granite, because I'm classy.

*Fath Stesokmonom* decided to help mine, how nice of her.

Close enough.

 But still just the two picks. This is going to be the kind of fun that takes a while.

### 26th Hematite, Early Summer

A good news, bad news situation here.

![zzzz](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/3I213j2t2J1G/Screen%20Recording%202015-12-22%20at%2010.42.20%20AM.gif)

*Lolor Kubukkanzud* has finally reached the cooking workshops area. The bad news is that is fell asleep there.

![almost brew time](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/0N0i1Q201N0x/Image%202015-12-22%20at%2010.50.29%20AM.png)

We are almost in the age of drink! The cooking workshop areas have been dug out.

### 16th Malachite, 125, Mid Summer

![all is well](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/1G0t0n0V353R/Image%202015-12-22%20at%2010.58.00%20AM.png)

All is well in the world. We can now cook and brew.

![in time](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/3V3g2i1M403b/Image%202015-12-22%20at%2010.58.25%20AM.png)

And we didn't even have a riot about it. How pleasant. How civilized, even!

![fishery](http://pixxx.wtf.cat/143j3r2L1W2W/Image%202015-12-22%20at%2010.58.55%20AM.png)

I'll add a fishery, for variety.

The only thing left is begin the production of food and drink. Which is totally on the agenda.

Everything is **JUST FINE**. Go me.
